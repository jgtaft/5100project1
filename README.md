# 5100project1
You are creating a non-interactive data visualization. You will use d3, but the final result will
be something that could be published on large-format paper or as a static PNG image on a
web page. We will grade your work as it appears when we load the HTML file in a browser.
We will not click, hover, or interact with anything. You are encouraged but not required to
integrate multiple data sources for this project. Each team has been assigned a TA. Your TA
is your best resource.

Good graphics are based on good data, attract readers' attention, don't frustrate readers,
and show the right amount of data (Chad Skelton summarizing Alberto Cairo).
Examples and sources: You are encouraged to get data and inspiration from other sites.
Make sure you acknowledge these in comments and in your written description. Any code
that you did not write yourself (such as d3) should go in a separate .js file. Unacknowledged
code or concept reuse will be handled with standard academic integrity procedures.
Submit a written status report to CMS midnight on Friday 2/17, 2/24, and 3/3 listing what
each member has been working on and what each will do next. If we need to differentiate
grades between team members we will use these reports as a basis. Also feel free to
contact your TA individually. For the second progress report include an image or scan of a
hand-drawn draft of your work. On-time completion of these reports will be worth 5
points.

Your final submission has two parts, a d3-based static data visualization (70 pts) and a
written description of your visualization (25 pts). Turn in a .zip archive containing:
1. An HTML page called index.html containing your visualization. Include any
additional script files (such as d3 or jQuery) and any additional data files, preferably
in JSON format. We will grade the following elements. You can show your TA a
prototype at any time. This section will be graded on the following elements:

A. Complexity of the data. Find a dataset that is manageable, but avoid trivial data.
There should be more than two variables, for example. An advanced project might
combine multiple datasets to provide a unique, novel perspective. Editing is
important! Beginning projects often have too little data or too much. Don't
overwhelm us with information. (10 pts)

B. Technical correctness. The code must actually do what you intend it to do. We also
prefer good style in coding: use informative variable names, consistent indenting
and whitespace, and informative comments. (20 pts)

C. Creativity. Advanced projects will make us think "how did they do that?" or use
something familiar in an unfamiliar way. Beginning projects often look like online examples or things we've seen before. Don't bore the judges! (10 pts)

D. Mapping from data to visual elements. Use scales such as position, shape, color, and
text appropriately for variables. (10 pts)

E. Usability. Someone viewing your work should be able to understand the data values
represented in the visualization easily and accurately. Advanced projects make
choices that are clear and intuitive, and may walk us through specific examples.
Beginning projects often leave us wondering what we're looking at. (10 pts)

F. Aesthetic quality. We don't want to judge a book by its cover, but aesthetics matter.
Your clients will make snap judgments about the quality of your work based on its
appearance, so put some time into polishing the look. Choose appropriate fonts,
colors, and visual details. (10 pts)

2. A PDF file containing a written description of your project. There are no specific page
or word limits. This document should contain:

A. A description of the data. Report where you got the data. Describe the variables. If
you had to reformat the data or filter it in any way, provide enough details that
someone could repeat your results. If you combined multiple datasets, specify how
you integrated them. Mention any additional data that you used, such as shape files
for maps. Editing is important! You are not required to use every part of the
dataset. Selectively choosing a subset can improve usability. Describe any
criteria you used for data selection. (10 pts)

B. A description of the mapping from data to visual elements. Describe the scales you
used, such as position, color, or shape. Mention any transformations you
performed, such as log scales. (10 pts)

C. The story. What does your visualization tell us? What was surprising about it? (5 pts)
